"If two production servers are communicating over port 22 directly, we can track it through a combination of system-level logs (/var/log/auth.log or auditd), user shell history, and network logs like AWS VPC Flow Logs or firewall monitoring. In our environment, we pipe these logs to a SIEM (Splunk), where weâ€™ve set alerts for lateral SSH attempts in restricted zones. To stay compliant, we enforce jump-host-based SSH, restrict east-west traffic at the firewall level, and audit all SSH usage as part of our ISO 27001 and SOC 2 posture."
